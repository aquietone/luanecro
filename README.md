# luanecro

A Necromancer bot using Lua.

## Description
This script will automate a level 120 necro in a group or raid setting. It expects all relevant spells and abilities to be present.
The script is designed to be compatible with CWTN class plugins as its what I use where available. So, it uses the same sort of command structure for modes, pausing, resetting camp and burning.

## Installation
Place the script in your MQ Lua folder.

## Usage
Start the script with `/lua run necrobot`.

## Support
Open issues (https://gitlab.com/aquietone/luanecro/-/issues)[here].

## Roadmap
Just a random project, don't really have any plans for it, beyond supporting my own needs.
